Useing Figure 2.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of merge sort on the
array A = 〈3, 41, 52, 26, 38, 57, 9, 49〉

           { 3,  9, 26, 38, 41, 49, 58}

    { 3, 26, 41, 52}             { 9, 38, 49, 57}

  { 3, 41}     {26, 52}        {38, 57}    { 9, 49}

{ 3, 41}          {52, 26}   {38, 57}        { 9, 49}
